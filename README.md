## Description

DinEz is a personal project providing a seamless, interactive self-ordering system for restaurants. This React Native app, built using Expo, allows customers to browse menus, place orders, and pay directly from their smartphones or tablets, enhancing both user convenience and restaurant efficiency.

## Planned Features

### 1. User-Friendly Interface

### 6. Push Notifications

- Implement push notifications to alert users when their order is ready or if there are any updates from the kitchen.

### 7. Kiosk Mode

- Design a kiosk mode for in-restaurant use, allowing customers to place orders via tablets at their tables or self-service kiosks.

### 8. Unit Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library to ensure robust and reliable code.
